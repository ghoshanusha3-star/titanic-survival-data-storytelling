## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---
## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Analyze survival patterns based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age
  - Fare
- Use visualizations to support insights
- Apply storytelling techniques to explain findings clearly

---

## 📊 Analysis Highlights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males  
- Passengers in higher classes (1st class) were more likely to survive  
- Age and fare played an important role in survival probability  
- Data visualization helped reveal hidden patterns and trends  

---
## 📈 Visualizations
The notebook includes:
- Bar plots
- Histograms
- Count plots
- Survival comparisons across different features

These visuals help transform raw data into clear, interpretable insights.
